                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p class="align-left">
                        Through ESB (Engineering Solutions at Berkeley), I was able to gain a lot of valuable experience working with startups all around the bay. As a student
                        who joined immediately after the club was created, the connections and lessons I learned from these semester long projects has help shaped many
                        aspects of my career and work thus far. Given a team of 5 engineers, each team is tasked to work with a startup ranging from bio-tech to UAV's, 
                        and has 4 months to work on specific projects the company needs. One such startup was Sentien Robotics [insert link], an early stage startup creating 
                        mobile drone fleet management systems. Their main project was the Hive-XL, a trailer sized vehicle carrying a heterogenous set of 80 drones to deploy
                        anywhere necessary. By having flight protocols and swarm controls localized to the Hive, Sentien is able to set up work wherever the drone fleet is needed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-left">
                        Our specific project was based on expanding the capabilities of the hive, moving into payload delivery
                        My team was tasked with 
                        creating an efficient storage and payload indexing system for the 
                        Hive, along with designing the 
                        end-effector for drones to carry the sorted packages.
                        Given a semester, access to the HiveXL and all its components, we had to protype and build a proof of concept on how the payload delivery would look on these
                        hive machines. In the first use-case the company wanted to try simple "tennis ball" style packages, a placeholder for fertilizer
                        packages to efficiently plant an entire field!

                    <h3>Design Overview</h3>
                    <p class="align-left">
                        The design we ended up going with consisted of 3 main compoennts. The acrylic holding container to which had all our tennis ball packages, an indexing 
                        system to load one ball in at a time, and the end-effector attatched to the drone allowing for easy pick-up. The hive itself provided
                        a tricky problem for this, as we had to juggle the many prodtruding geometries of the back of the trailer. Primiarily, ensuring that the 
                        drones were able to reach the exit point of the container would be the most diffuclt part, something we based our container deisgn off of.
                        The container was designed with the
                        Hive in mind, allowing for easy removeability while still being fully supported by the trailer. Under, the indexing system was inspired by a ski-ball
                        mechanism, utilzing simple servo control to ensure a single ball was deployed each time. The 3rd (and argueably coolest) mechanism was the end-effector,
                        and all the wireless communiation that came with it. This was my part of the project, as we split up work early in the semester to ensure all aspects
                        that the company wanted would be delivered. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-left">
                        Due to the limited time frame given to teams for the competitions,  having a fleshed-out design done as quickly as possible is extremely important. 
                        After leading multiple meetings discussing our goals/priorities for the bot, we had a generic list of what our end goal should look like. I developed my 
                        CAD skills the previous year by working on designing the 2021 robot, allowing me to spearhead the design for this year. 

                        Starting with initial 2D side concept sketches, I then started CAD from the ground up. For 2022, our CAD team was severely limited compared to previous 
                        years, so splitting up work was vital. I led both the shooter subsytem, and the drivetrain subsystem. Setting a deadline of 2 weeks, we managed to have 
                        a full assembly of our robot (including fasteners).

                    <h3>Mechanisms</h3>
                    <p class = 'align-left'>Drivetrain:This year’s Drivetrain design is a 6-wheel “West Coast Drive,” equipped with Andymark Performance wheels in the center and Colson wheels on the side. With a WCP SS Gearbox, Hamazon is able to dash around the field very quickly and efficiently. Because of our team’s discussion during our Match Strategy meeting, we aimed to build a Drivetrain that would be able to play defense, (due to the defensive nature of this game), and be robust enough to survive a fall during the climb, both of which led us to this design. </p>
                    <p class = 'align-left'>Shooter: The Shooter is equipped with dual 4’’ launch wheels capable of running at 5,000 RPM to consistently score in the UPPER HUB. 
                        The Limelight is positioned at the front of the shooter to allow for precise shooting and positioning of the robot relative to the retroreflective tape
                        The shooter is my favorite mechanism, since I was able to take it start to finish with many cool and new ideas for the team. The shooter had 2 massive 
                        4 inch wheels in the front, with geometry that optimized the compression on the game pieces for shooting them out. There are also smaller "backspin wheels", 
                        imperative to reduce the magnus effect that the balls would face when being shot. By adjusting the belt + gear ratio to allow the backspin wheels to have
                         the same tip-speed as main wheels, I was able to eliminate the back-spin effect causing balls to be unpredictable. Modeling the shooter in Desmos also 
                         allowed me to find optimal speeds given our geometry and the MOI we needed for our flywheel to give the consecutive balls the same power level when shot.

                    <h3>Manufacturing + Assembly</h3>
                    <p class = 'align-left'>After the CAD was completed, manufacturing of many different parts began. All the sheet metal on our robot is completed by Magnus Hi-Tech, 
                        a sponsor company that is able to plasma-cut, bend, and even powder coat our metal (Magnus spreadsheet). Everything else on the robot is 
                        machined in-house through the use of the machines at our build space (lathes, mills, CNC routers & hand tools). Specifically, I utilized the CNC Router the
                        most, for the complex geometries we needed to produce, especailly for early prototypes. After completing all 
                        required in-house machining with an organizational spreadsheet, assembly was able to begin with the sheet metal parts. Using CAD as a reference, 
                        assembly of the robot ran very smoothly. Originally starting with the drivetrain and working our way up, Hamazon's assembly was able to be completed 
                        efficiently, leaving enough time for programmers and drive practice.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion/Next Steps</h3>
                    <p class = "align-left">Overall, this was one of my favorite engineering projects so far, being able to combine skills to create a very tangible and very successful robot. 
                        As this was my senior year, I would not be able to compete in these competitions from the future, as FRC is only aimed for high-schoolers. That being said,
                        I have ensured that the team will still go strong even after the current class graduates, by teaching and preparing the newer class in many technical and 
                        soft skills. This, along with starting a proper documentation system (Part Spreadsheets, Tech Binders) ensured that not only was I able to have a successful 
                        senior year building the robot, but that the team would have a good framework to continue in the following years!
