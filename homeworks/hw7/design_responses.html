							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the importance of the brain when exploring graphic design. The article says that if you understand how people are able to think, it would be the best way to create an effective UI/UX design to allow for the best responses. For example it is easiest for the brain to identify simple designs of familiar things. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was when the author goes over each specific science behind her argument. They give examples on things such as the concepts of proximity, and invariance. Most importantly, the author also descibes how this would effect designers, which is very useful </p>
