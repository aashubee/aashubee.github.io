                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned many cool ways to have an interactive design for your websites. All the UX designs shown had alot of character when interacted with. This gave me a solid foundation for ideas that I could possibly use in the future for design.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favoirte part was all the examples they gave for the article. There was not much filler information, only good UI/UX design ideas. Alot of them will be inspirational for design in the future. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite interface was the one used for crypto. The colors popped alot, and seemed very futuristic. This paired with the simplicity of it allowed them to convey their product. It also helps that it is not as clustered as other designs.</p>
