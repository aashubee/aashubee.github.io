                    <p class="align-left">
                        As a member of CRB (Combat Robotics at Berkeley), me and my team designed and built a 15 pound combat robot for the Sacremento Bot Battles. 
                        With a ___ wheel drive and an egg beater style weapon, HOLY CR@B made it to the semi-finals of the compettiion, with an impressive K.O count!

                    <h3>Design Overview</h3>
                    <p class="align-left">As all good projects do, my team started with brainstorming and ideation of what we wanted our robot to look like. I led a chunk of this process, 
                        allowing us to settle on ideas earlier on that other teams. We priotized speed in our robot, so utilzing a 4WD with 2 motors was the best option. 
                        We also used an eggebeater style weapon donated to us by a previous bot, allowing us to save costs and invest in other important areas of the bot.
                        The bot was designed in Fusion 360, which was a relatively new platform for me. Using my previous experinece in Autodesk Inventor and Solidwokrs,
                        I was able to complete a large portion of the design, focusign on the drive systems and the weapon structure. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-left">
                        Due to the limited time frame given to teams for the competitions,  having a fleshed-out design done as quickly as possible is extremely important. 
                        After leading multiple meetings discussing our goals/priorities for the bot, we had a generic list of what our end goal should look like. I developed my 
                        CAD skills the previous year by working on designing the 2021 robot, allowing me to spearhead the design for this year. 

                        Starting with initial 2D side concept sketches, I then started CAD from the ground up. For 2022, our CAD team was severely limited compared to previous 
                        years, so splitting up work was vital. I led both the shooter subsytem, and the drivetrain subsystem. Setting a deadline of 2 weeks, we managed to have 
                        a full assembly of our robot (including fasteners).

                    <h3>Mechanisms</h3>
                    <p>Drivetrain:This year’s Drivetrain design is a 6-wheel “West Coast Drive,” equipped with Andymark Performance wheels in the center and Colson wheels on the side. With a WCP SS Gearbox, Hamazon is able to dash around the field very quickly and efficiently. Because of our team’s discussion during our Match Strategy meeting, we aimed to build a Drivetrain that would be able to play defense, (due to the defensive nature of this game), and be robust enough to survive a fall during the climb, both of which led us to this design. </p>
                    <p>Shooter: The Shooter is equipped with dual 4’’ launch wheels capable of running at 5,000 RPM to consistently score in the UPPER HUB. 
                        The Limelight is positioned at the front of the shooter to allow for precise shooting and positioning of the robot relative to the retroreflective tape
                        The shooter is my favorite mechanism, since I was able to take it start to finish with many cool and new ideas for the team. The shooter had 2 massive 
                        4 inch wheels in the front, with geometry that optimized the compression on the game pieces for shooting them out. There are also smaller "backspin wheels", 
                        imperative to reduce the magnus effect that the balls would face when being shot. By adjusting the belt + gear ratio to allow the backspin wheels to have
                         the same tip-speed as main wheels, I was able to eliminate the back-spin effect causing balls to be unpredictable. Modeling the shooter in Desmos also 
                         allowed me to find optimal speeds given our geometry and the MOI we needed for our flywheel to give the consecutive balls the same power level when shot.

                    <h3>Manufacturing + Assembly</h3>
                    <p>After the CAD was completed, manufacturing of many different parts began. All the sheet metal on our robot is completed by Magnus Hi-Tech, 
                        a sponsor company that is able to plasma-cut, bend, and even powder coat our metal (Magnus spreadsheet). Everything else on the robot is 
                        machined in-house through the use of the machines at our build space (lathes, mills, CNC routers & hand tools). Specifically, I utilized the CNC Router the
                        most, for the complex geometries we needed to produce, especailly for early prototypes. After completing all 
                        required in-house machining with an organizational spreadsheet, assembly was able to begin with the sheet metal parts. Using CAD as a reference, 
                        assembly of the robot ran very smoothly. Originally starting with the drivetrain and working our way up, Hamazon's assembly was able to be completed 
                        efficiently, leaving enough time for programmers and drive practice.</p>
