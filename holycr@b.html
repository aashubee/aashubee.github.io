                    <p class="align-left">
                        As a member of CRB (Combat Robotics at Berkeley), me and my team designed and built a 15 pound combat robot for the Sacremento Bot Battles 2023, where we won 2nd place! 
                        In this tournamnet, 32 teams fought in a double elimination bracket, consiting of everywhere from high school seniors to experienced builders with decades 
                        of experience. HOLY CR@B went undefeated for its matches, loosing only to a power management issue in the final rounds of the tourney. As Driver for the bot,
                        I had alot of fun being able to manuaver and strategize my teams hard work for the past 2 semesters!
                        With a  speedy 4 wheel drive and an egg beater style weapon, HOLY CR@B made it to the finals of the competition, with an impressive 4-2 KO count!

                    <h3>Design Overview</h3>
                    <p class="align-left">As all good projects do, my team started with brainstorming and ideation of what we wanted our robot to look like. I led a chunk of this process, 
                        allowing us to settle on ideas earlier on that other teams. We prioritized speed in our robot, so utilizing a 4WD with 2 motors was the best option. 
                        Our bot was equipped with an eggbeater style weapon donated to us by a previous bot, allowing us to save costs and invest in other important areas of the bot.
                        We also put heavy consideration into the wedges of our bot, since our strategy was to get under the opponents to be able to deal damage to the least protected parts
                        of the robot. Work on the bot started early September, with the competition happening mid March.
                        The bot was designed in Fusion 360, which was a relatively new platform for me. Using my previous experience in Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks,
                        I was able to create some of the design for the weapon and drivetrain sub-systems, allowing us to reach the efficient and speedy goal the team brainstormed early
                        in the project.

                    <h3>Drivetrain</h3>
                    <p>The Drivetrain was the mechanism I worked the most on, and arguably the most important mechanism. Powered by ________ motors, we made sure to do calcualations
                        before hand to determine max speed, power and other important factors that would affect our total weight. This was all CAD-ed in Fusion 360, along with basic 
                        FEA to ensure that we strenghted any specific points along the chassis that needed it. With a belt system, we powered all 4 of our wheels, while simulationusly
                        ensuring our motor was protected from enemy robots. Manufactured out of ________ Aluminum from SendCutSend, we received the parts as quickly as possible, 
                        and started the building process to harden the drivetrain. I also "battle hardened" the motors, which is the process of dis-assembing them and applying epoxy
                        to best prevent any damange during the match. By making smart decisions when it came to type of drivetrain, material, manufacturability and motor selection, our
                        team was able to have a durable yet speedy drivetrain to race through the competition.

                    <h3>Challeneges</h3>
                    <p>One Specific challenge I would like to highlight was that with our weapon. Our weapon was manufactured out of S7 Tool Steel (Fun Fact: This was manufactured
                        from the same company that creates GLITCH's huge eggbeater weapon), the same steel used to manufacture drill bits and other metal tools. As mentioned,
                        we used a previous robot's weapon to save on cost that could be put into other aspects, but still ensured our design fit around these constraints. Unfortunately, 
                        when we tried the initial weapon spin up, we noticed that our bearings placed around the dead shaft of the weapon were failing, despite calculating that these bearings
                        would be able to handle the forces. We had to cautiously try to find the root of this problem, since there were many possible reasons (wrong bearings, bent shaft etc.)
                        Since this was so close to the competition, many of my team members just wanted to remove the weapon, or just replace the bearings to see what would happen.
                        Instead, by carefully debugging piece by piece, I was able to realize that the bearings were breaking due to the MOI of the weapon being different then where we calculated it. 
                        This is most likely due to the previous beating it had taken last year when it was in action, resulting in it being off-center, resulting in extreme vibrations the bearing
                        could not handle. As a solution, I had to angle-grind areas of the weapon to ensure an equal distribution of mass, allowing the rotational point to be around the shaft 
                        as we planned it to be. This approach worked, and by carefully trying to understand where the root cause was before making any decisions, we were able to get the best part
                        of our robot back in action.
                    </p>
                    
                        <h3>Outcome and Achievements</h3>
                    <p>At the Sacremento Bot Battles 2023, HOLY CR@B !! went on to win second place at the competition, loosing the last match due to a bad battery connection. 
                        I drove the bot for the entire competition, which was a very fun and engaging experience. We had some amazing fights, and more importantly I was 
                        able to learn so much from all the capable builders at the competition, from college students to very experienced engineers. In terms of next steps,
                        I plan on revisiting the bot to make improvements that we realized we needed from this competition. This includes sourcing different parts for our inner frame (kept bending under combat)
                        ,sourcing different batteries for better discharge rates, and improve our front wedge design to get under opponents easier!
                     </p>
